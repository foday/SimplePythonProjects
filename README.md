# SimplePythonProjects
I am attempting to write 12 Python projects in order to learn Python. 
Project 1: Madlibs.py Using string concatenation - In a traditional madlib you will have a bunch of blanks in a paragraph and you would have someone 
fill out those blanks and then read the paragraph out loud with the words that they chose in those blanks.
We are gonig to recreate this project in Python using string concatenation.
Concatenation means joining strings together end-to-end to create a new string. To concatenate strings, we use the + operator. 
Keep in mind that when we work with numbers, + will be an operator for addition, but when used with strings it is a joining operator.
String Concatenation
String concatenation means add strings together.
Use the + character to add a variable to another variable

  coder = "foday"
  a. writing the variable with a stored name and outputing it to the terminal along with a concatenated text ex: print("subscribe to " + coder)
  b. using {} to output a string ex print("subscribe to {}".format(coder))
  c. Using 'f' to format the string in the {} ex" print(f"subscribe to {coder}")
